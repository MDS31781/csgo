Files associated with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

McDonalds-MDS-CSGO is missing a couple texture files that were not included in the compiled map for some reason. The fix for this is to download these files into the following location:

(Path to Steam)\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\materials\models\MDS\mcdonalds

Files:

ordersignpost.vmt
ordersignpost.vtf
ordersignroof.vmt
ordersignroof.vtf
