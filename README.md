Files associated with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

McDonalds-MDS-CSGO is missing a couple texture files that were not included in the compiled map for some reason. The fix for this is to download these files (included in the zip file) into the following location:

(Path to Steam)\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\materials\models\MDS\mcdonalds

This path will not likely exist past the \steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\materials\ so you may have to manually create the subfolders.
